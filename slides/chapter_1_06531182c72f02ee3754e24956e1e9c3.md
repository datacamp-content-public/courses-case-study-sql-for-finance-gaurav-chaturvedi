`@script`
In the previous lesson you applied the concept of required margin and unrealized gain.

In this lesson, you will learn about Free Margin. You will use SQL Joins, Aggregations and Calculated Fields to compute Free Margin. 

So let's get started!

## Let's Recap (1/3)

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 7a659077fe
```

`@part1`
&nbsp;

## 1. Customer A starts with USD 10k in the account 
&nbsp;

`@script`
Free margin is derived from required margin and unrealized gain, so lets recap these 2 concepts.

Let's say on the 1st of January, Customer A starts with <click> Ten Thousand US Dollars in his account.

## Let's Recap (2/3)

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 17af617ee7
```

`@part1`
&nbsp;

## 2. Customer A buys 1 lot of EUR-USD @ 1.092  
@4% margin he needs margin of EUR 4k (or USD 4,368 @1.092) {{1}}
&nbsp;

![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5112/datasets/2462a083ca467ddd22bb376538ce2a1ff1e392dd/Img2.png =50) {{2}}

`@script`
Customer A then buys 1 lot of EUR-USD at the exchange rate of 1.092. 

Recall that this means he buys 100,000 EUR against USD at 1 EUR = 1.092 USD. 

<click> He needs to keep aside a margin for this position. 
4% margin for EUR-USD currency pair, means Four Thousand Euros as margin for this position of 100,000 Euros. 

Since the account is in USD, we convert the required margin of Four Thousand Euros into USD - @1.092 it works out to 4,368 USD.

<click> Customer A has less disposable cash due to the margin.

## Let's Recap (3/3)

```yaml

## 3. EUR-USD exchange rate moves to 1.122
Customer A has a profit of **USD 3,000** {{1}}
&nbsp;

![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5112/datasets/c62e10eeebf665fa0aca42b94d873b418c4b8797/Img3.png =50) {{2}}

`@script`
Next day 2nd January, the exchange rate moves in his favour to 1.122. <click> In the last lesson we have seen that this means an unrealized gain of 3,000 USD. 

Lets recap how. For every EUR he holds he gains 0.03 USD ;  which is the current rate of 1.122 minus the purchase rate of 1.092. 
He holds 100,000 EUR. That means his total  unrealised gain is 0.03 * 100,000 which is 3,000 USD.

<click>
Customer A's disposable cash just went up by that much.

## Definition of Free Margin

```yaml

**Free margin = Cash Balance - Required Margin + Unrealised Gain ** {{1}}

`@script`
After taking into account the effect of required margin and unrealized gain Customer A has USD 8,632 at his disposal. 

This is Free Margin. 
<click> 
Mathematically it is equal to:
Cash Balance - Required Margin + Unrealised Gain

`@script`
Time to have some fun with data and SQL. 

In this lesson you will use 2 input datasets 
No. 1 ‚Äùfx_positions_plus". This is the dataset we created in the previous lesson. This has all open positions and the 2 key computed fields - required margin and unrealised gain
No. 2 customer_balance. This is a new dataset this has the cash balance for all customers. 

You will create an output dataset called cust_free_margin. This will have the required margin, unrealised gain and free margin at the customer level.

## Calculating Free Margin - Step 1

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: e140bab8b5
```

`@part1`
&nbsp;
## Aggregate required margin and unrealized gain at customer level and create a new intermediate table 
&nbsp;

```
SELECT 
SUM() -- fields to aggregate
INTO customer_margin_gain
FROM fx_position_plus 
GROUP BY () -- customer level 
``` {{1}}

`@script`
You will compute Free Margin in 3 steps. 

Step 1: Aggregate the required margin and unrealised gain  at the customer level and create a new intermediate table.

<click>
You will use SUM and Group By to aggregate from the fx_position_plus table and INTO to create a new table.

---

## Calculating Free Margin - Step 2

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 93dd34aa84
```

`@part1`
&nbsp;
## Join this new table with the customer balance table
&nbsp;

```
SELECT 
INTO customer_margin_gain_balance
FROM 
fx_position_plus a, 
INNER JOIN customer_balance b
ON (a. = b.) -- use the joining key
```

`@script`
You have the required margin and the unrealized gain at the customer level. You still need the cash balance. 

In Step 2 , you will Join the newly created table in Step 1 with the customer_balance table and create another intermediate table. 

For this step you will use INNER JOIN.

## Calculating Free Margin - Step 3

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: e850309f8c
```

`@part1`
&nbsp;
## Compute the Free Margin 

**Free Margin** = Cash Balance + Unrealised Gain - Used Margin
&nbsp;

```
SELECT 
() as customer_free_margin
-- other fields as per the outcome dataset
INTO cust_free_margin
FROM 
customer_margin_gain_balance
```

`@script`
You have all the 3 data points to calculate Free Margin. 

In Step 3, you will use the formula of Free Margin and create a new table. This will be our output dataset customer_free_margin

You will use calculated fields with alias to compute Free Margin.
