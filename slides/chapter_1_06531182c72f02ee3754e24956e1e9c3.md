`@script`
In the previous lesson you applied the concept of required margin and unrealized gain.

In this lesson, you will learn about Free Margin. You will use SQL Joins, Aggregations and Calculated Fields to compute Free Margin. 

So let's get started!

## Let's Recap (1/3)

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 7a659077fe
```

`@part1`
&nbsp;

## 1. Customer A starts with USD 10k in the account 
&nbsp;

`@script`
Free margin is derived from required margin and unrealized gain, so lets recap these 2 concepts.

Let's say on the 1st of January, Customer A starts with <click> Ten Thousand US Dollars in his account.

## Let's Recap (2/3)

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 17af617ee7
```

`@part1`
&nbsp;

## 2. Customer A buys 1 lot of EUR-USD @ 1.092  
@4% margin he needs margin of EUR 4k (or USD 4,368 @1.092) {{1}}
&nbsp;

![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5112/datasets/2462a083ca467ddd22bb376538ce2a1ff1e392dd/Img2.png =50) {{2}}

`@script`
Customer A then buys 1 lot of EUR-USD at the exchange rate of 1.092. 

Recall that this means he buys 100,000 EUR against USD at 1 EUR = 1.092 USD. 

<click> He needs to keep aside a margin for this position. 
4% margin for EUR-USD currency pair, means Four Thousand Euros as margin for this position of 100,000 Euros. 

Since the account is in USD, we convert the required margin of Four Thousand Euros into USD - @1.092 it works out to 4,368 USD.

<click> Customer A has less disposable cash due to the margin.

## Let's Recap (3/3)

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 5996f992b5
```

`@part1`
&nbsp;

## 3. EUR-USD exchange rate moves to 1.122
Customer A has a profit of **USD 3,000** {{1}}
&nbsp;

![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5112/datasets/c62e10eeebf665fa0aca42b94d873b418c4b8797/Img3.png =50) {{2}}

`@script`
The exchange rate moves in his favour to 1.122. <click> This means a gain of USD 3,000. 

Lets recap how. For every EUR he holds he gains USD 0.03 which is the current rate of 1.122 minus the purchase rate of 1.092. 
He holds 100,000 EUR. That means his total  unrealised gain is 0.03 * 100,000 which is USD 3,000.

<click>
Customer A's disposable cash just went up by that much.

## So what is Free Margin?

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 14c26a1b41

## Free Margin
**Cash Balance - Required Margin + Unrealised Gain **

`@script`
This means he now has USD 8,632 is his account that he can use as he pleases - he can use that to take new positions or simply withdraw it from the account. 

This is Free Margin. 

Free Margin is the NET amount of $  available to the customer at any point in time. Mathematically it is equal to:
 Cash Balance + Unrealised Gain - Used Margin

Please note that Unrealised loss should be subtracted (while gain is added)

`@script`
We have seen 3 datasets till the last chapter. 
1."fx_rates" has the currency rates by date. 
2."fx_positions_plus" dataset has all customer open positions and the 2 computed fields - required margin and unrealised gain
3."margin_master" has currency pair wise margin requirement in percentage. 
 
In this lesson we will introduce a new Customer level dataset called customer_balance. The customer opening cash balance will be provided in this table.

## Outcome Dataset

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: bb76bdb380

`@script`
You will create a new dataset that has cash balance required margin, unrealised gain and free margin at the customer level. 

We will do this in 3 steps.

## Calculating Free Margin - Step 1

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: e140bab8b5
```

`@part1`
&nbsp;
## Aggregate required margin and unrealized gain at customer level. Create a new table 
&nbsp;

```
SELECT 
SUM() -- fields to aggregate
INTO customer_margin_gain
FROM fx_position_plus 
GROUP BY () -- customer level 
```

`@script`
Step 1: Aggregate the required margin and unrealised gain from the fx_position_plus table to create a new table customer_margin_gain.
We will use SUM and Group By to aggregate and INTO to create a new table.

---

## Calculating Free Margin - Step 2

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 93dd34aa84
```

`@part1`
&nbsp;
## Join this new table with the customer balance table
&nbsp;

```
SELECT 
INTO customer_margin_gain_balance
FROM 
fx_position_plus a, 
INNER JOIN customer_balance b
ON (a. = b.) -- use the joining key
```

`@script`
Step 2: Now you need to Join this newly created table with customer_balance table to bring the cash balance together with the required margin and unrealized gain. Lets call this new table customer_margin_gain_balance. 

Use INNER JOIN to do this.

---

## Calculating Free Margin - Step 3

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: e850309f8c
```

`@part1`
&nbsp;
## Compute the Free Margin 

**Free Margin** = Cash Balance + Unrealised Gain - Used Margin
&nbsp;

```
SELECT 
() as cust_free_margin
-- other fields as per the outcome dataset
INTO customer_free_margin
FROM 
customer_margin_gain_balance
```

`@script`
Now you have the 3 data points to calculate Free Margin for a Customer. Use the formula of Free Margin to add a new field in the customer_margin_gain_balance table. We call the new table customer_free_margin

You will use calculated files with alias to compute Free Margin.
