In the previous lesson you applied the concept of Mark to Market (MTM) using 2 datasets - FX Rates and FX Positions. 

In this lesson, you will learn about Free Margin. You will use SQL Joins and Subqueries to compute Free Margin. So let's get started!

## Let's continue the MTM example

```yaml
type: TwoColumns
key: b3b9bbec89
disable_transition: true
code_zoom: 100
```

`@part1`
**1. Customer A starts with USD 10k in the account  ** 

`@part2`

`@script`
Customer A buys 1 lot of EUR-USD @ 1.092. This means he buys EUR 100,000 against USD at the exchange rate 1 EUR = 1.092 USD

@4% margin for EUR-USD currency pair, Customer A needs to provide a EUR 4k (or USD 4,368 @ exchange rate of 1.092) margin or “downpayment” for this trade

Next day EUR-USD exchange rate moves to 1.122. Each EUR is worth USD 0.03 more now, hence Profit on his position of EUR 100,000 is USD 3,000 (0.03*100,000)

The bank or online platform where Customer A trades  will need a minimum security of USD 3k (2k margin + 1 k to cover the loss)
